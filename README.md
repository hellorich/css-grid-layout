# CSS Grid Layout test

Test implementation of [Fran√ßois Remy's CSS Grid polyfill](https://github.com/FremyCompany/css-grid-polyfill) to check it's viability for a client project.

## Installation

Node and the Node Package Manager are the easiest way to set up the project and its dependencies.

1.  Install Node.js using the instructions [here](http://nodejs.org/).
2.  Install Grunt using the command `npm install -g grunt-cli`. More detailed instructions are available at [gruntjs.com](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).
3.  Clone the repository to your local file system and install dependencies inside by running `npm install` inside the root of the repository.
4.  Once all dependencies are downloaded you can build the project by running `grunt make`.
5.  To work with the code run `grunt go` to start BrowserSync and monitor the mustache, SASS, JavaScript and images inside the src directory for changes.
